based game.It is also a First Person Shooter.Arguably the best shooter to date.Halo takes place in a futuristic imaginative world.With aliens bent on filling out a prophecy.You play as a cyborg/human

landscapes.From beaches to mountainous snowy horizons.You crash land on an ancient planet.With an mechanical touch.It's name is Halo and it's shaped like a ring.Hordes of aliens out number you,but you have many options on how to approach this.You can creep about and take them down one by one or gun them all down and toss a few grenades to sweeten the deal.This game has builtin co-op wich is the prime meat of this game in my opinion.Co-op lets you replay the story the same exact way but 2 cyborgs now take on such a challenge.You and a friend can easily overcome the on comming frauth easily with teamwork.Change the diffaculty and let your enemies now have a bigger one-up on you.They are now smarter and stronger,and they actually use these new abilities.The multiplayer plays out like any other FPS,gun down friends or catch a flag.Heres the catch you can make your own game type awsome.The vehicles are stunning and crafty from the tanks to the gohst(a futuristic enemy craft).The weapon variety is fantastic.Handguns are nice with an optical zoom for tactical operations.Snipers and AR rifles are in here with nice new touches.The alien weapondry is vast and advanced and lower shields

battle and go over many landscapes.From beaches to mountainous snowy horizons.You crash land on an ancient planet.With an mechanical touch.It's name is Halo and it's shaped like a ring.Hordes of

builtin co-op wich is the prime meat of this game in my opinion.Co-op lets you replay the story the same exact way but 2 cyborgs now take on such a challenge.You and a friend can easily overcome the

enemy is the Covenant small airship thing that shoots lasers at you (no not the dropship), you usually meet the airships in the Library level and then you see them in mostly every level after that.The Floods are: The bouncing head things which die in 1 shot from any gun and barely do any damage even though they use suicide attacks on you, Then there are the Flood infected people which used to be

a futuristic imaginative world.With aliens bent on filling out a prophecy.You play as a cyborg/human who is the last of his kind.Created by years of work and research.You fight the aliens (the covenent) gun to gun in this epic other wordly game.You guide marines in battle and go over many landscapes.From beaches to mountainous snowy horizons.You crash land on an ancient planet.With an mechanical touch.It's name is Halo and it's shaped like a ring.Hordes of aliens out number you,but you have many options on how to approach this.You can creep about and take them down one by one or gun them all down and toss a few grenades to sweeten the deal.This game has builtin co-op wich is the prime meat of this game in my opinion.Co-op lets you replay the story the same exact way but 2 cyborgs now take on such a challenge.You and a friend can easily overcome the on comming frauth easily with teamwork.Change the diffaculty and let your enemies now have a bigger one-up on you.They are now smarter and stronger,and they actually use these new abilities.The multiplayer plays out like any other FPS,gun down friends or catch a flag.Heres the catch you can make your own game type awsome.The vehicles are stunning and crafty from the tanks to the gohst(a futuristic enemy craft).The weapon variety is fantastic.Handguns are nice with an optical zoom for tactical operations.Snipers and AR rifles are in here with nice new touches.The alien weapondry is vast and advanced and lower shields easily.Fight a parasitic creature the covenent fear and find the truth of Halos purpose at

story,"['I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys an amazing epic story.', 'The story line is so great filled with twistsand turns it keeps you coming back for more.', 'WARNING: there is a newer version of this game for the xbox 360 it is called halo cobat evolved anniversary and has better graphics firefight and everything else as wellHeres how my reviews go first I say how fun and overall how good the game was youll get story review to but for this one its pretty short.', 'The levels in this game are very unique even if three of them are reused later on it makes sense for them to be reused in the story.', 'The story is revolutionary it even holds up well today.The multiplayer is really really good and you can play the whole campaign in co-op but be warned there is friendly fire.', 'The story is believable, the characters seem real, and it all comes together nicely.Gameplay: this is my favorite part of the game.', ""Most of you should know the story but the forerunners made the halo's."", ""The story is well-planned and well-paced, the weapons are oh-so-cool, the digital surround sound helps to hear behind you (online challengers don't stand a chance), the music is stirring and epic, and the graphics are simply jaw-dropping."", ""Now that Halo Reach is coming out, I wanted to finish it once and for all and played the last 3 hours or so of the game.First things first is that there's not a lot of story IN the first Halo game."", 'First of all, I would have liked to have had more story in the game itself instead of having to read a prequel novel to get the full impact of the game.', ""Sure, this game has had rave reviews, and I'm basing this on games released in the same time period.Yes, there is a story."", ""But Halo's topnotch story, voice acting and script leaves the original, almost 10 years old, as one of the best games of all time."", ""This is a minor problem, but the frame-rate is still smooth enough to allow for fluid gameplay.The story is quite compelling, and quite unique as well, and does a great job of grabbing the players' attention."", ""I had this game at first for the computer, and I really liked it, but I only borrowed it from a friend, and didn't have time to finish the main story."", 'Recently, I ordered this game from here, and now, after almost finishing the main story, I have to say, it really is just as fun as any good, new, Xbox 360 game on the market today.', 'Awesome story, responsive controls, great graphics, and an awesome main character who kicks (bad word) and takes names.STORY:You are Spartan-117, a lone Spartan(all the others were killed) created for war.', 'It was fun playing story mode with a friend, and the multiplayer maps were awesome!', ""I favored the maps that held vehicles (Sidewinder, Blood Gulch).The story mode was and still is great to play, though since I have beaten it numerous times in the past years it's not as exciting, mainly because I know what to expect now."", ""Neither sequels have a better story line, I think, and the Spartan armor is cool and better looking than the armor in the second Halo.Few things I dislike about this game is that you can't be an Elite."", ""Apparently there were more of these enhanced super soldiers, but the Halo story line mostly follows the story of Master Chief and to find out about the others you'll just have to read the novels."", ""Apparently there were more of these enhanced super soldiers, but the Halo story line mostly follows the story of Master Chief and to find out about the others you'll just have to read the novels."", ""Play through this amazing game's story to find out just what is hidden in the vast reaches of the universe.I have to say that this is one of the most fun games I have ever played and has tons of replay value."", 'One of the things that really set this apart from others is the co-op play that the system allows in order to play through the story with a friend.', ""Ultimately I can safely say that I still associate the name of Bungie with the word quality and while the Halo story isn't as huge or engrossing as Marathon, they've still written something very enthralling for us to enjoy."", 'I just got this game a week ago and have been playing it as much as I can ever since.It\'s graphics are great,the story is great,the gameplay is great,split screen is great.Now I haven\'t played it online(Don\'t got DSL or Broadband)so I can\'t talk about it.And don\'t think for one moment that just because it\'s a few years old it isn\'t any good,cause it\'s still one of the best and will probably be 2,3 decades from now.I\'ve played the PS2 for a long time,I just got my X-Box last christmas(had a PS2 since MOH Frontline),and have played many Fps\'s and ""Halo Killers"" on it,and the most I\'ve seen is a few games that MIGHT be AS good as Halo,I have seen none better(I\'m not including Halo 2 or 3,because I haven\'t played them).If you are looking for a hardcore FPS this is it,if you are looking for an all around fun game this is it,if you are looking for a great game to play with friends this is it.What all this review is trying to tell you is that this game is worth every penny,nickel and dime you spend on it,period.Buy this game,if you don\'t like it you can sell it and get something else,but you most likely won\'t be selling it.', 'This is the best Halo game because it has the best story and the coolest guns pretty much everything is good', 'But, no matter how easy the controls were, where ""Halo"" suffered the most was in the development of the story and scenery.', ""I didn't go too deeply into the multi-player aspects or the team play because honestly, I play games for the story and adventure."", 'I am looking for a stronger story in ""Halo 2"", as well as more captivating bad guys, a stronger score (for those that speak highly of this ... watch Akira, you can find the same music there), and more weapons.', 'It has great graphics a nice story

date.Halo takes place in a futuristic imaginative world.With aliens bent on filling out a prophecy.You play as a cyborg/human who is the last of his kind.Created by years of work and research.You fight the aliens (the covenent) gun to gun in this epic other wordly game.You guide marines in battle and go over many landscapes.From beaches to mountainous snowy horizons.You crash land on an ancient planet.With an mechanical touch.It's name is Halo and it's shaped like a ring.Hordes of aliens out number you,but you have many options on how to approach this.You can creep about and take them down one by one or gun them all down and toss a few grenades to sweeten the deal.This game has builtin co-op wich is the prime meat of this game in my opinion.Co-op lets you replay the story the same exact way but 2 cyborgs now take on such a challenge.You and a friend can easily overcome the on comming frauth easily with teamwork.Change the diffaculty and let your enemies now have a bigger one-up on you.They are now smarter and stronger,and they actually use these new abilities.The multiplayer plays out like any other FPS,gun down friends or catch a flag.Heres the catch you can make your own game type awsome.The vehicles are stunning and crafty from the tanks to the gohst(a futuristic enemy craft).The weapon variety is fantastic.Handguns are nice with an optical zoom for tactical operations.Snipers and AR rifles are in here with nice new touches.The alien weapondry is vast and advanced and lower shields easily.Fight a parasitic creature the covenent fear and find the truth of Halos purpose at the depths of Halo center.Work along side your fellow marines to the very end and last but not least make it out alive."", 'The movie cuts that help explain the story are visually

research.You fight the aliens (the covenent) gun to gun in this epic other wordly game.You guide marines in battle and go over many landscapes.From beaches to mountainous snowy horizons.You crash land on an ancient planet.With an mechanical touch.It's name is Halo and it's shaped like a ring.Hordes of aliens out number you,but you have many options on how to approach this.You can creep about and take them down one by one or gun them all down and toss a few grenades to sweeten the deal.This game has builtin co-op wich is the prime meat of this game in my opinion.Co-op lets you replay the story the same exact way but 2 cyborgs now take on such a challenge.You and a friend can easily overcome the on comming frauth easily with teamwork.Change the diffaculty and let your enemies now have a bigger one-up on you.They are now smarter and stronger,and they actually use these new abilities.The multiplayer plays out like any other FPS,gun down friends or catch a flag.Heres the catch you can make your own game type awsome.The vehicles are stunning and crafty from the tanks to the gohst(a futuristic enemy craft).The weapon variety is fantastic.Handguns are nice with an optical zoom for tactical operations.Snipers and AR rifles are in here with nice new touches.The alien weapondry is vast and advanced and lower shields easily.Fight a parasitic creature the covenent fear and find the truth of Halos purpose at the depths of Halo center.Work along side your fellow marines to the very end and last but not least make it out alive."", 'Like many games, you basically run around shooting
