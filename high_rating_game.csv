down and toss a few grenades to sweeten the deal.This game has builtin co-op wich is the prime meat of this game in my opinion.Co-op lets you replay the story the same exact way but 2 cyborgs now take on such a challenge.You and a friend can easily overcome the on comming frauth easily with teamwork.Change the diffaculty and let your enemies now have a bigger one-up on you.They are now smarter and stronger,and they actually use these new abilities.The multiplayer plays out like any other FPS,gun down friends or catch a flag.Heres the catch you can make your own game type awsome.The vehicles are stunning and crafty from the tanks to the gohst(a futuristic enemy craft).The weapon variety is fantastic.Handguns are nice with an optical zoom for tactical operations.Snipers and AR rifles are in here with nice new touches.The alien weapondry is vast and advanced and lower shields easily.Fight a parasitic creature the covenent fear and find the truth of Halos purpose at the depths of Halo

date.Halo takes place in a futuristic imaginative world.With aliens bent on filling out a prophecy.You play as a cyborg/human who is the last of his kind.Created by years of work and research.You fight the aliens (the covenent) gun to gun in this epic other wordly game.You guide marines in battle and go over many landscapes.From beaches to mountainous snowy horizons.You crash land on an ancient planet.With an mechanical touch.It's name is Halo and it's shaped like a ring.Hordes of aliens out number you,but you have many options on how to approach this.You can creep about and take them down one by one or gun them all down and toss a few grenades to sweeten the deal.This game has builtin co-op wich is the prime meat of this game in my opinion.Co-op lets you replay the story the same exact way but 2 cyborgs now take on such a challenge.You and a friend can easily overcome the on comming frauth easily with teamwork.Change the diffaculty and let your enemies now have a bigger one-up on you.They are now smarter and stronger,and they actually use these new abilities.The multiplayer plays out like any other FPS,gun down friends or catch a flag.Heres the catch you can make your own game type awsome.The vehicles are stunning and crafty from the tanks to the gohst(a futuristic enemy craft).The weapon variety is fantastic.Handguns are nice with an optical zoom for tactical operations.Snipers and AR rifles are in here with nice new touches.The alien weapondry is vast and advanced and lower shields easily.Fight a parasitic creature the covenent fear and find the truth of
