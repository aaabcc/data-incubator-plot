enhanced and improved and there's a lot to discover and several hours fun you will get not just by beating the game but by leveling up, gaining new skills, combining these new skills to build up the perfect set of techniques for each battle, even with the same class the skills you select make you fight and play in several different ways and of course the armor and weapons, you will fin yourself playing for hours and hours just to find the next great addition to your swords collection or that nice looking helm that boosts up your strength, etc..

be enough for a casual gamer that would like to just beat the story or the hardcore games that like to spend the next months or even more.Graphics:Very good, the detail is great, the effects are nice

place you are it should, the voices, audio, narration, etc.. is just great, you can change the languages and feel your own experience in different ways and it is always great.Storyline:The Story is great, captivating and epic.. you could not ask for more... wait, yes, I do would like to ask for more since the game's story is overall short, you can probably beat the game (in normal difficulty)

damage); so all the spells feel bland/feel the same./pointless you could equip ""throw squirel"" and it would do same damage as ""Fire Beam"".The wizard is a joke, Teleport is horrible.In Short, if
